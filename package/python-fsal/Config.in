        File System Abstraction Layer is a system which provides a few high 
        level operations on files & folders. The intended utility is for 
        Librarian & other apps to use this to perform File Manager like 
        operations.

        The heavyweight filesystem operations are performed by the daemon via 
        XML based IPC calls.
